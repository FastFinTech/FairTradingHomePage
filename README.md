# FairTrading — Single Page Demo

This repository contains a polished single-page website demonstrating the FairTrading prop futures ecosystem. It's a static demo built from the content outline provided.

Files:

- `index.html` — Single-page HTML with hero, features, platform, trading room, competition, prop firm sections and contact form.
- `styles.css` — Responsive, professional styles.
- `script.js` — Small interactions: smooth scrolling and demo signup toast.

How to view locally:

1. Open the folder in your file manager.
2. Double-click `index.html` or open it in your browser.

Notes:

- This is a static demo. The contact form is client-side only (no backend). Integrate with your preferred backend or email provider as needed.
- Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts (Inter).

Next steps (suggested):

- Add logo and brand assets under an `assets/` folder.
- Hook the signup form to an email provider or server endpoint.
- Add accessibility audits, i18n, or A/B variants for copy testing.
